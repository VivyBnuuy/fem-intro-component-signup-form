Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This is my first JavaScript project! I didn't have much trouble with the form itself or manipulating the DOM, the challenging part was the regular expression for the email address - I hadn't worked with regex before and it was REALLY difficult to start learning! I initially tried to validate way too much and realized I didn't actually know what could and couldn't go into an email address, so that was a lot of learning.

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM
- Vanilla JavaScript

# Looking Back
- I'll definitely make a habit of learning what is and isn't valid before validating anything in a form going forward.
- Regular Expressions are MUCH more difficult than anything I've picked up so far - I think I'm getting the hang of it, but it'll definitely require a lot of practice to get comfortable with it.
- I'm still not 100% of the way I'm validating the email, but after asking a couple fellow developers and looking online, it seemed the general consensus for real world use was to check for basic things like this project does, and then send a verification email - The user will notice the email isn't coming in and try again, or notice the email wasn't correct to begin with if it's outside the validation's scope.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
